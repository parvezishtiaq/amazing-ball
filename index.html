    <h2>Balls in Sports, Games, and Leisure</h2>
    <p>A ball is a spherical object that can be used for various purposes such as sports, games, and toys. It is typically made of rubber, plastic, or leather. The size and weight of a ball can vary depending on its intended use. For instance, basketballs are larger and heavier than tennis balls. Balls can be used for solo play or with others. They can be kicked, thrown, bounced, or hit with a bat or racket. Balls are an essential part of many activities and have been around for centuries.</p>
